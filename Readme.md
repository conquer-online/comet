# Comet
Comet is a Conquer Online server project containing an account server and game server. The account server authenticates players, while the game server services players in the game world. This simple two-server architecture acts as a good introduction into server programming and networking. 

### Getting Started
To get started, download and install [.NET Core 2.1.4](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1) or higher. This project uses [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for lightweight development, and is highly recommended but ultimately optional. After installing both, open Comet in a terminal window and enter the command `dotnet restore`. You may also wish to install the C# extension for Visual Studio Code. When done, restart Visual Studio Code. Then, you'll be ready to build.
