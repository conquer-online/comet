## Forking
If you'd like to take the project in a new direction or perform a section of work, then I highly recommend forking the project. You can fork the repository using the "Fork" button on the front page of the GitLab repository. This copies the project repository and all commits to your own GitLab profile. If you choose to make your fork public, it also allows others to find your modified version of the project more easily through GitLab.

## Merge Requests
1. Ensure that the project builds and the client can log in
2. Update the readme with any changes, if necessary
3. Update public API documentation with any changes, if necessary
4. Code is documented and addresses a functional or behavioral requirement
5. Commit your changes to its own fork and create a merge request in GitLab

Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
